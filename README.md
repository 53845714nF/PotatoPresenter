# Potato Presenter

Tool to create presentation slides that can be exported as PDF.

Content and appearance of slides is defined in a simple text format, similar to LaTeX.
This text is then converted into a set of slides.
Additionally, elements' position and size can be interactively adjusted with the mouse.

### Arguments after Commands

You can give arguments in square brackets after a commands that are similar to the CSS Properties:

List of supported arguments:

Argument | Functionality | Example Values
------------ | ------------------ | -------------
color | Color of font, arrow, line. | blue, #aa55ff
font | Font name. | Hack
font-size | Font-size. | 50
text-align | Text alignment. | left, right, center, justify
line-height | Fraction of line height. | 1.5
font-weight | Font weight. | bold, normal
opacity | Opacity of whole element. | 0.7
background | Background color of element. | red, #aa55ff
border | Creates a border around the element. | 2px solid blue
left | Sets the position of the element left. | 100
top | Sets the position of the element top. | 100
width | Sets the position of the element width. | 100
height | Sets the position of the element height. | 100
angle | Sets the rotation angle in degree. | 180
movable | Element cannot manipulate with the mouse. | false, true
id | ID of element. | see section ID
class | Class of element. | see section Class
defineclass | Defines a class. | see section Class


### Classes

Elements can have a class given by the argument ```class```.
Predefined classes are:  
```title, body, fullscreen, leftcolumn, rightcolumn```  
A class can specify a list of arguments which the element has by default, e.g. the position or the font-size.
Nevertheless, arguments can also be given to an element and override the given by the class.
Elements with a class can also be manipulated on the right panel.
When using templates, elements with the same class on different slides can have different properties.  
With the argument ```defineclass``` you can define the properties and position of an element as a new class and use it later on.  
Have a look at the example:  
```\text[defineclass: myClass; color: green] Hello ```  
```\text[class: myClass] I am green.```  
Here the second element would have the color green and will be rendered at the same position as the first element.


### ID 

Every Box has an ID. The application saves the position and the ID of every Box.
Usually, the box ID is generated by the application and contains the frame ID, the box type and class.
If the ID is not unique, a counter is added.
So, if you rename your frame or swap some boxes in the text file, the boxes' geometry may change.
You can define an ID to a Box with the argument ```id```.
